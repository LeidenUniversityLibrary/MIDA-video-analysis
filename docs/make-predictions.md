title: Make predictions
---

When you have a model that is good enough, you can use it to predict whether
symbols are visible on other unlabeled frames.

# Create frame list

The script that runs the model is based on the script for evaluation.
It reads the filenames of the frames, as well as the expected labels from a CSV
file.
We therefore need to create the CSV file first.

# Make predictions from the frame list



# Look at the statistics



# Convert frame predictions to interval-based annotations
