# MIDA-video-analysis
Computer vision in television

## Install on Apple M1

Because the M1 chipset has an architecture based on ARM instead of x86_64,
we cannot use Python and Tensorflow from the default channels.

In a Terminal, run `conda env create -f environment_m1.yml -n mida_video`
to create a conda environment with basic dependencies for running the scripts
in this repository.
Afterwards, run `conda activate mida_video` to activate the environment.

If you want more manual control, install Tensorflow following instructions at
<https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/>.
Then install the other dependencies listed in `environment_m1.yml`.

## Usage

The provided scripts help us train, evaluate and use computer-vision models
based on Tensorflow and Keras.

Please see the [documentation](docs/index.md) in this repository, or the
[rendered online documentation][online_docs] for usage instructions.
